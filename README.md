We Together aims to address these challenges by establishing a robust self-help group
(SHG) platform that prioritizes women's empowerment while including men. The
initiative seeks to provide a supportive ecosystem where women can develop
entrepreneurial skills, access financial resources, and participate actively in decisionmaking processes. By leveraging the collective strength of SHGs, 'We Together' aims to
foster economic independence and social cohesion among participants.It also addresses
SDG goal 5 and 9 .
